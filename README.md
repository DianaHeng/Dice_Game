# <h1 align="center">Dice Game </h1>
<p align="center"> The objective of this project is to develop a computer-based game that allows two players to compete against each other in a dice-rolling game. The game will be designed to simulate the rules outlined above, where players take turns rolling a dice to accumulate points in each round. The first player to reach a total of 100 points on their global score wins the game. The project will involve programming the game logic, creating a user-friendly interface, and testing the game to ensure that it functions correctly and provides an enjoyable user experience. </p>
<h2 align="center">Game Rules</h2>
<table align="center">
<ul>
<li>The game involves two players who take turns playing rounds.</li>
<li>On each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they want and adds the results to their round score.</li>
<li>If any of the players rolls a 1, the current round score will be lost; and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
<li>The player can choose to 'Hold', which adds their round score to their global score, and then it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
<li>The game ends when a player reaches a global score of 100 or more points. That player is declared the winner.</li>
